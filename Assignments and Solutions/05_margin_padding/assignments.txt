Here are some **practical assignment questions** to help you master **margin** and **padding**:

---

### **Basic Questions**
1. **Simple Box Layout**:  
   Create a `div` with a width of `200px`, padding of `20px`, and margin of `30px`. Calculate the total width of the `div` when:
   - `box-sizing: content-box`
   - `box-sizing: border-box`

---

### **Intermediate Questions**
2. **Spacing Between Elements**:  
   Create a series of three `div` elements stacked vertically. Use:
   - Padding to increase the space inside the `div`s.
   - Margin to control the spacing between the `div`s.  

   Adjust the spacing to make the gap between the boxes exactly `20px`. Use the browser's developer tools to verify your solution.

3. **Center a Box**:  
   Center a `div` both **horizontally** and **vertically** in the viewport using margin.  
   Constraints:
   - The box should have `width: 50%` and `height: 200px`.
   - Add `padding: 20px` and a `border: 5px solid black` to the box.

### **Advanced Questions**
4. **Nested Padding**:  
   Create a parent `div` with a child `div` inside it.  
   - Apply `padding` of `20px` to the parent `div`.
   - Apply `margin` of `10px` to the child `div`.  
   Question: How does the margin of the child affect its position relative to the parent?

5. **Overlapping Margins**:  
   Create two stacked `div` elements where the **top margin** of the second `div` overlaps with the **bottom margin** of the first.  
   - Investigate and explain how **margin collapsing** works.
   - Fix the overlap to ensure the margins add up as expected.

---

6. **Responsive Box**:  
   Create a responsive `div` with the following requirements:
   - Use percentages for margin and padding.
   - The padding should adjust dynamically based on the size of the viewport.
   - Add a `border` and verify how the box scales with the viewport width.

---

7. **Grid Layout with Padding and Margin**:  
   Create a 3x3 grid of square boxes (like a tic-tac-toe board).  
   - Add `padding` inside each box to make the content look well-spaced.
   - Add `margin` between the boxes to ensure there is consistent spacing between them.

---

### **Challenge Questions**
8. **Margin vs Padding in Button Design**:  
   Design a button that:
   - Uses **padding** to ensure the text inside the button is spaced evenly.
   - Uses **margin** to control the space between multiple buttons.  
   Test how the button looks when the text length changes.

---

9. **Recreate a Card Layout**:  
   Create a card layout where each card has:
   - A title, description, and image.
   - Use `padding` to ensure the content inside the card looks well-spaced.
   - Use `margin` to create space between multiple cards.

---

10. **Combination of Margins and Padding**:  
    Create a web page with a header, content area, and footer:
    - Add padding inside each section to ensure the content doesn't touch the edges.
    - Add margins between the sections to create visual separation.

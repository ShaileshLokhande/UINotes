### **Assignment: Working with Background Images in Web Design**

#### **Objective:**
To understand and implement background images in web design using HTML and CSS. You will explore different properties of CSS to style background images effectively.

---

### **Instructions:**

1. **Set Up:**
   - Create a folder named `background-images-assignment`.
   - Inside the folder, create two files: `index.html` and `styles.css`.

2. **Requirements:**
   You must complete the following tasks:

   #### **Part 1: Simple Background Image**
   - Add a `div` with the class `background-1`.
   - Set a background image for the `div` using CSS.
   - Make the background image:
     - Cover the entire `div`.
     - Be responsive.

   #### **Part 2: Multiple Background Images**
   - Add a `div` with the class `background-2`.
   - Apply multiple background images to this `div`.
   - Use CSS to:
     - Specify the size and position of each background image.
     - Ensure images donâ€™t overlap unless intended.

   #### **Part 3: Fixed Background Image**
   - Create a section with some dummy content (e.g., paragraphs or headings).
   - Set a fixed background image for this section (parallax effect).
   - The background should remain stationary when you scroll the page.

   #### **Part 4: Gradient and Background Combination**
   - Add a `div` with the class `background-4`.
   - Apply a background gradient over a background image.
   - Experiment with gradient transparency.

   #### **Part 5: Pattern Background**
   - Use a small image to create a pattern (tiled) background for a `div` with the class `background-5`.

3. **Enhancements (Optional):**
   - Add hover effects to some of the `div` elements. For example:
     - Change the background image on hover.
     - Change the gradient colors on hover.
   - Add transitions or animations to make the effects smooth.

---

### **Example Output:**
Your webpage should demonstrate the following:
1. A full-screen background image (`background-1`).
2. A `div` with multiple layered background images (`background-2`).
3. A parallax effect with fixed background (`background-3`).
4. A combination of gradient and image (`background-4`).
5. A pattern-tiled background (`background-5`).

---

### **Submission Guidelines:**
- Submit the `background-images-assignment` folder as a zipped file.
- Ensure your code is well-formatted and commented.
- Include screenshots of the output in a folder named `screenshots`.
